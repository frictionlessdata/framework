    "- `create_loader`\n",
    "- `create_parser`\n",

    "To create a plugin you need:\n",
    "- create a module called `frictionless_<name>` available in PYTHONPATH\n",
    "- subclass the Plugin class and override one of the methods above\n",

    "This example is over-simplified to show the high-level mechanics but writing Frictionless Plugins is designed to be easy. For inspiration, you can checks the `frictionless/plugins` directory and learn from real-life examples. Also, in the Frictionless codebase there are many `Check`, `Control`, `Dialect`, `Loader`, `Parser`, and `Server` implementations - you can read their code for better understanding of how to write your own subclass or reach out to us for support."
