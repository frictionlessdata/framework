# Working with AWS

> Status: **EXPERIMENTAL**

Frictionless supports reading data from S3 cloud source. You can read file in any format that is available in your bucket.

```sh
! pip install frictionless[aws]
```

## Reading from AWS

You can read from this source using `Package/Resource` or `Table` API, for example:

```py
from frictionless import Resource

resource = Resource(path='s3://bucket/table.csv')
print(resource.read_rows())
```

For reading from a private bucket you need to setup AWS creadentials as it's described in [Boto3 documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html#environment-variables).

## Writing to AWS

The same is actual for writing:

```py
from frictionless import Resource

resource = Resource(path='data/table.csv')
resource.write('s3://bucket/table.csv')
```

## Configuring AWS

There is a control to configure how Frictionless read files in this storage. For example:

```py
from frictionless import Resource
from frictionless.plugins.aws import S3Control

resource = Resource(data=[['id', 'name'], [1, 'english'], [2, 'german']])
resource.write('table.new.csv', control=controls.S3Control(endpoint_url='<url>'))
```
