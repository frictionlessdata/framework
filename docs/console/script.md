```markdown remark type=info
Wit this command Frictionless will drop all invalid data like type errors in cells. Use `validate` if needed.
```

With `script` command you can explore tabular files with Pandas by one console command. For example:

```bash
frictionless script https://zenodo.org/record/3977957
```

```yaml image
