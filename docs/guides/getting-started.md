title: Getting Started
---

Let's get started with Frictionless! We will learn how to install and use the framework. The simple example below will showcase the framework's basic functionality.

## Installation

> The framework requires Python3.6+. Versioning follows the [SemVer Standard](https://semver.org/)

```bash
$ pip install frictionless
$ pip install frictionless[sql] # to install a core plugin
$ frictionless --version
4.0.0
```

The framework supports CSV, Excel, and JSON formats by default. Please use the command above to install a core plugin and add support for SQL, Pandas, HTML, and others (check the [list of Frictionless Framework plugins and their status](https://framework.frictionlessdata.io/docs/references/plugins-reference)). Usually, you don't need to think about it in advanceâ€“frictionless will display a useful error message about a missing plugin with installation instructions.

## Usage

The framework can be used:
- as a Python library
- as a command-line interface
- as a restful API server

For instance, all the examples below do the same thing:

```python
# Python:
from frictionless import extract
rows = extract('data/table.csv')
```

```bash
# CLI
$ frictionless extract data/table.csv
```

```
# API:
[POST] /extract {"source': 'data/table.csv"}
```

All these interfaces are as much alike as possible regarding naming conventions and the way you interact with them. Usually, it's straightforward to translate, for instance, Python code to a command-line call. Frictionless provides code completion for Python and the command-line, which should help to get useful hints in real time.

Arguments conform to the following naming convention:
- for Python interfaces, they are snake_cased, e.g. `missing_values`
- within dictionaries or JSON objects, they are camelCased, e.g. `missingValues`
- in the command line, they use dashes, e.g. `--missing-values`

To get the documentation for a command-line interface just use the `--help` flag:

```bash
$ frictionless --help
$ frictionless describe --help
$ frictionless extract --help
$ frictionless validate --help
$ frictionless transform --help
```

## Example

> All the examples use the data folder from [this](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/frictionless-py/) repository

We will take a very messy data file:

```bash
$ cat data/invalid.csv
```

```
id,name,,name
1,english
1,english

2,german,1,2,3
```

First of all, let's use `describe` to infer the metadata directly from the tabular data. We can then edit and save it to provide others with useful information about the data:

> This output is in [YAML](https://yaml.org/), it is a default Frictionless output format.


```bash
$ frictionless describe data/invalid.csv
```

```
---
metadata: data/invalid.csv
---

encoding: utf-8
format: csv
scheme: file
hashing: md5
name: invalid
path: data/invalid.csv
profile: tabular-data-resource
schema:
  fields:
    - name: id
      type: integer
    - name: name
      type: string
    - name: field3
      type: integer
    - name: name2
      type: integer
```

Now that we have inferred a table schema from the data file (e.g., expected format of the table, expected type of each value in a column, etc.), we can use `extract` to read the normalized tabular data from the source CSV file:

```bash
$ frictionless extract data/invalid.csv
```

```
---
data: data/invalid.csv
---

====  =======  ======  =====
id    name     field3  name2
====  =======  ======  =====
   1  english  None    None
   1  english  None    None
None  None     None    None
   2  german        1      2
====  =======  ======  =====
```

Last but not least, let's get a validation report. This report will help us to identify and fix all the errors present in the tabular data, as comprehensive information is provided for every problem:


```bash
$ frictionless validate data/invalid.csv
```

```
---
invalid: data/invalid.csv
---

====  =====  ===============  ====================================================================================
row   field  code             message
====  =====  ===============  ====================================================================================
None      3  blank-label      Label in the header in field at position "3" is blank
None      4  duplicate-label  Label "name" in the header at position "4" is duplicated to a label: at position "2"
   2      3  missing-cell     Row at position "2" has a missing cell in field "field3" at position "3"
   2      4  missing-cell     Row at position "2" has a missing cell in field "name2" at position "4"
   3      3  missing-cell     Row at position "3" has a missing cell in field "field3" at position "3"
   3      4  missing-cell     Row at position "3" has a missing cell in field "name2" at position "4"
   4  None   blank-row        Row at position "4" is completely blank
   5      5  extra-cell       Row at position "5" has an extra value in field at position "5"
====  =====  ===============  ====================================================================================
```

Now that we have all this information:
- we can clean up the table to ensure the data quality
- we can use the metadata to describe and share the dataset
- we can include the validation into our workflow to guarantee the validity
- and much more: don't hesitate and read the following sections of the documentation!
