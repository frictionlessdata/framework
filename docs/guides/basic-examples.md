> This example assumes that you are familiar with the concepts behind the Frictionless Framework. For an introduction, please read the [Introduction](introduction.md).

Let's start with an example dataset. We will look at a few raw data files that have recently been collected by an anthropologist. The anthropologist wants to publish this data in an open repository so her colleagues can also use this data. Before publishing the data, she wants to add metadata and check the data for errors. We are here to help, so letâ€™s start by exploring the data. We see that the quality of data is far from perfect. In fact, the first row contains comments from the anthropologist! To be able to use this data, we need to clean it up a bit.

As we can see, it's a data containing information about European countries and their populations. Also, it's easy to notice that there are two fields having a relationship based on a country's identifier: neighbor_id is a Foreign Key to id.

## Describing Data

First of all, we're going to describe our dataset. Frictionless uses powerful [Frictionless Data Specifications](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/). They are very handy to describe:
- a data table - [Table Schema](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/)
- a data resource - [Data Resource](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-resource/)
- a data package - [Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/)
- and other objects

Let's describe the `countries` table:

<Tabs
defaultValue="cli"
values={[{ label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'}, { label: 'Python', value: 'python'}]}>
<TabItem value="cli">

```bash script
frictionless describe countries.csv # add --stats to get statistics
```
```yaml
# --------
# metadata: countries.csv
# --------

encoding: utf-8
format: csv
hashing: md5
layout:
  headerRows:
    - 2
name: countries
path: countries.csv
profile: tabular-data-resource
schema:
  fields:
    - name: id
      type: integer
    - name: neighbor_id
      type: string
    - name: name
      type: string
    - name: population
      type: string
scheme: file
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">


```python script
from pprint import pprint
from frictionless import describe

resource = describe('countries.csv')
pprint(resource)
```
```
{'encoding': 'utf-8',
 'format': 'csv',
 'hashing': 'md5',
 'layout': {'headerRows': [2]},
 'name': 'countries',
 'path': 'countries.csv',
 'profile': 'tabular-data-resource',

                       {'name': 'neighbor_id', 'type': 'string'},
                       {'name': 'name', 'type': 'string'},
                       {'name': 'population', 'type': 'string'}]},
 'scheme': 'file'}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


As we can see, Frictionless was smart enough to understand that the first row contains a comment. It's good, but we still have a few problems:
- we use `n/a` as a missing values marker
- `neighbor_id` must be numerical: let's edit the schema
- `population` must be numerical: setting proper missing values will solve it
- there is a relation between the `id` and `neighbor_id` fields

Let's update our metadata and save it to the disc:

<Tabs
defaultValue="cli"
values={[{ label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'}, { label: 'Python', value: 'python'}]}>
<TabItem value="cli">

```bash
frictionless describe countries.csv --yaml > countries.resource.yaml
editor countries.resource.yaml
```

> Open this file in your favorite editor and update as it's shown below

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">


```python script
from frictionless import Detector, describe

detector = Detector(field_missing_values=["", "n/a"])
resource = describe("countries.csv", detector=detector)
resource.schema.get_field("neighbor_id").type = "integer"
resource.schema.foreign_keys.append(
    {"fields": ["neighbor_id"], "reference": {"resource": "", "fields": ["id"]}}
)
resource.to_yaml("countries.resource.yaml")
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Let's see what we have created:

<Tabs
defaultValue="cli"
values={[{ label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'}, { label: 'Python', value: 'python'}]}>
<TabItem value="cli">

```bash script
cat countries.resource.yaml
```
```yaml
encoding: utf-8
format: csv
hashing: md5
layout:
  headerRows:
    - 2
name: countries
path: countries.csv
profile: tabular-data-resource
schema:
  fields:
    - name: id
      type: integer
    - name: neighbor_id
      type: integer
    - name: name
      type: string
    - name: population
      type: integer
  foreignKeys:
    - fields:
        - neighbor_id
      reference:
        fields:
          - id
        resource: ''
  missingValues:
    - ''
    - n/a
scheme: file
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">


```python script
with open('countries.resource.yaml') as file:
    print(file.read())
```
```yaml
encoding: utf-8
format: csv
hashing: md5
layout:
  headerRows:
    - 2
name: countries
path: countries.csv
profile: tabular-data-resource
schema:
  fields:
    - name: id
      type: integer
    - name: neighbor_id
      type: integer
    - name: name
      type: string
    - name: population
      type: integer
  foreignKeys:
    - fields:
        - neighbor_id
      reference:
        fields:
          - id
        resource: ''
  missingValues:
    - ''
    - n/a
scheme: file
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


It has the same metadata as we saw above but also includes our editing related to missing values and data types. We didn't change all the wrong data types manually because providing proper missing values had fixed it automatically. Now we have a resource descriptor. In the next section, we will show why metadata matters and how to use it.

## Extracting Data

It's time to try extracting our data as a table. As a first naive attempt, we will ignore the metadata we saved on the previous step:

<Tabs
defaultValue="cli"
values={[{ label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'}, { label: 'Python', value: 'python'}]}>
<TabItem value="cli">

```bash script
frictionless extract countries.csv
```
```
# ----
# data: countries.csv
# ----

==  ===========  =======  ==========
id  neighbor_id  name     population
==  ===========  =======  ==========
 1  Ireland      Britain  67
 2  3            France   n/a
 3  22           Germany  83
 4               Italy    60
 5
==  ===========  =======  ==========
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">


```python script
from pprint import pprint
from frictionless import extract

rows = extract('countries.csv')
pprint(rows)
```
```
[{'id': 1, 'neighbor_id': 'Ireland', 'name': 'Britain', 'population': '67'},
 {'id': 2, 'neighbor_id': '3', 'name': 'France', 'population': 'n/a'},
 {'id': 3, 'neighbor_id': '22', 'name': 'Germany', 'population': '83'},
 {'id': 4, 'neighbor_id': None, 'name': 'Italy', 'population': '60'},
 {'id': 5, 'neighbor_id': None, 'name': None, 'population': None}]
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Actually, it doesn't look terrible, but in reality, data like this is not quite useful:
- it's not possible to export this data e.g., to SQL because integers are mixed with strings
- there is still a basically empty row we don't want to have
- there is a clear mistake in Germany's neighborhood!

Let's use the metadata we save to try extracting data with the help of Frictionless Data specifications:

<Tabs
defaultValue="cli"
values={[{ label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'}, { label: 'Python', value: 'python'}]}>
<TabItem value="cli">

```bash script
frictionless extract countries.resource.yaml
```
```
# ----
# data: countries.resource.yaml
# ----

==  ===========  =======  ==========
id  neighbor_id  name     population
==  ===========  =======  ==========
 1               Britain          67
 2            3  France
 3           22  Germany          83
 4               Italy            60
 5
==  ===========  =======  ==========
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">


```python script
from pprint import pprint
from frictionless import extract

rows = extract('countries.resource.yaml')
pprint(rows)
```
```
[{'neighbor_id': None, 'id': 1, 'name': 'Britain', 'population': 67},
 {'neighbor_id': 3, 'id': 2, 'name': 'France', 'population': None},
 {'neighbor_id': 22, 'id': 3, 'name': 'Germany', 'population': 83},
 {'neighbor_id': None, 'id': 4, 'name': 'Italy', 'population': 60},
 {'neighbor_id': None, 'id': 5, 'name': None, 'population': None}]
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


It's now much better! Numerical fields are numerical fields, and there are no more textual missing values markers. We can't see in the command-line, but missing values are now `None` values in Python, and the data can be e.g., exported to SQL. Although, it's still not ready for being published. In the next section, we will validate it!

## Validating Data

Data validation with Frictionless is as easy as describing or extracting data:

<Tabs
defaultValue="cli"
values={[{ label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'}, { label: 'Python', value: 'python'}]}>
<TabItem value="cli">

```bash script
frictionless validate countries.csv
```
```
# -------
# invalid: countries.csv
# -------

===  =====  ============  =============================================================================
row  field  code          message
===  =====  ============  =============================================================================
  4      5  extra-cell    Row at position "4" has an extra value in field at position "5"
  7      2  missing-cell  Row at position "7" has a missing cell in field "neighbor_id" at position "2"
  7      3  missing-cell  Row at position "7" has a missing cell in field "name" at position "3"
  7      4  missing-cell  Row at position "7" has a missing cell in field "population" at position "4"
===  =====  ============  =============================================================================
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">


```python script
from pprint import pprint
from frictionless import validate

report = validate('countries.csv')
pprint(report.flatten(["rowPosition", "fieldPosition", "code"]))
```
```
[[4, 5, 'extra-cell'],
 [7, 2, 'missing-cell'],
 [7, 3, 'missing-cell'],
 [7, 4, 'missing-cell']]
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Ahh, we had seen that coming. The data is not valid; there are some missing and extra cells. But wait a minute, in the first step, we created the metadata file with more information about our table. We have to use it.

<Tabs
defaultValue="cli"
values={[{ label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'}, { label: 'Python', value: 'python'}]}>
<TabItem value="cli">

```bash script title="CLI"
frictionless validate countries.resource.yaml
```
```
# -------
# invalid: countries.csv
# -------

===  =====  =================  ==============================================================================================================
row  field  code               message
===  =====  =================  ==============================================================================================================
  3      2  type-error         Type error in the cell "Ireland" in row "3" and field "neighbor_id" at position "2": type is "integer/default"
  4      5  extra-cell         Row at position "4" has an extra value in field at position "5"
  5         foreign-key-error  Row at position "5" violates the foreign key: not found in the lookup table
  7      2  missing-cell       Row at position "7" has a missing cell in field "neighbor_id" at position "2"
  7      3  missing-cell       Row at position "7" has a missing cell in field "name" at position "3"
  7      4  missing-cell       Row at position "7" has a missing cell in field "population" at position "4"
===  =====  =================  ==============================================================================================================
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">


```python script
from pprint import pprint
from frictionless import validate

report = validate('countries.resource.yaml')
pprint(report.flatten(["rowPosition", "fieldPosition", "code"]))
```
```
[[3, 2, 'type-error'],
 [4, 5, 'extra-cell'],
 [5, None, 'foreign-key-error'],
 [7, 2, 'missing-cell'],
 [7, 3, 'missing-cell'],
 [7, 4, 'missing-cell']]
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Now it's even worse, but regarding data validation errors, the more, the better, actually. Thanks to the metadata, we were able to reveal some critical errors:
- the bad data types, i.e. `Ireland` instead of an id
- the bad relation between `id` and `neighbor_id`: we don't have a country with id 22

In the next section, we will clean up the data.

## Transforming Data

We will use metadata to fix all the data type problems automatically. The only two things we need to handle manually:
- France's population
- Germany's neighborhood

<TabItem value="cli">

$ cat > countries.pipeline.yaml <<EOF

    steps:

```python script
from frictionless import Resource, describe, transform, steps

def clean(resource):
    current = resource.to_copy()

    # Data
    def data():
        with current:
            for row in current.row_stream:
                if row["name"] == "France":
                    row["population"] = 67
                if row["name"] == "Germany":
                    row["neighbor_id"] = 2
                if row["name"]:
                    yield row

    # Meta
    resource.schema = Resource("countries.resource.yaml").schema
    resource.data = data

source = describe("countries.csv")
target = transform(
    source,
    steps=[
        clean,
        steps.table_write(path="countries.csv"),
    ],
)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Finally, we've got the cleaned version of our data, which can be exported to a database or published. We have used a CSV as an output format but could have used Excel, JSON, SQL, and others.

<Tabs
defaultValue="cli"
values={[{ label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'}, { label: 'Python', value: 'python'}]}>
<TabItem value="cli">

```bash script
cat countries.csv
```
```

1,,Britain,67
2,3,France,67
3,2,Germany,83
4,,Italy,60
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">


```python script
with open('countries.csv') as file:
    print(file.read())

id,neighbor_id,name,population
1,,Britain,67
2,3,France,67
3,2,Germany,83
4,,Italy,60
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Basically, that's it; now, we have a valid data file and a corresponding metadata file. It can be shared with other people or stored without fear of type errors or other problems making data research not reproducible.

<Tabs
defaultValue="cli"
values={[{ label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'}, { label: 'Python', value: 'python'}]}>

output = subprocess.check_output('ls countries.*', shell=True)
print(output.decode('utf-8'))
```
```

In the next articles, we will explore more advanced Frictionless' functionality.
