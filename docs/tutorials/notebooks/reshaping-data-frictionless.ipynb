In this example, we are using a dataset that has been formatted for human reading, but not for machine readability. By the end of this tutorial, the dataset will be machine readable!\n","\n","We will also be adding metadata to this dataset using Frictionless **Describe**. Adding metadata is important for understanding what the data is. In our example dataset, the authors have provided some metadata, but it is contained within three separate datasets, so there is some friction involved in accessing and understanding the metadata. We'll use Frictionless Describe to quickly infer some metadata and then edit the metadata to add more information.\n","\n","For this tutorial, we are going to use open data from a recent publication about sourdough starters, as several of the Frictionless team are avid bakers. The publication is titled *The diversity and function of sourdough starter microbiomes* and can be accessed at this link [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.61644](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.61644).
