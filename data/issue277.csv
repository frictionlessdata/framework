Paler shade of grey brown.,clear,Na,Na,"Compact sandy silt making up floor surface (10).\n\nPossibly a naturally formed surface in the south-east corner of the trench, forming a long narrow pathway used by people? Very difficult to know for sure, but sediment is certainly more compact than the overlying tumble (6) and contains fewer cobble and boulder inclusions.

It is essentially only aeolian soil mixed with patches of winter rain wash, minor bioturbation from winter growth roots, and loose stones. Concentrated mainly in the east along the section, where the soil was a thicker deposition above the tarp, and still clung in clumps and lenses to the section face. Material from this area (the east side of the  trench, along the sections and within the spaces/rooms was sieved. The clearly intrusive loose topsoil spillage (come in from above the east section) and wash/aeolian soil above tumble and walls was not sieved. The most intensive cleaning was the upper terrace of rooms (in the east). We worked methodically from upslope in the east down to the lower western terraces. As soon as we reached the extant tumble (deposit 9), it became obvious that a full intensive clean was going to inadvertently excavate in-situ material from the tumble layer (see asu 51*1). At this point, we switched to spot cleaning the obviously intrusive wash or aeolian soil away, and the context was closed. This ""context"" is essentially unstratified in terms of the Harris Matrix, (and so has been consciously excluded from the temporal matrix, although it has been assigned spatial relationships in order to clarify affected deposits) but it does represent a short-term modern deposition of material accrued in the trench between seasons. \n\n(Note: in general ASU's will be given spatial relationships to other ASUs - because ASU's are arbitrary, I have been putting the primary spatial and temporal relationships into the deposit record, and only relating ASUs to other ASUs spatially in order to assist with chasing up related assemblages from ASUs excavated above or below; the temporal relationships should only exist for deposits/structures/surfaces, unless we have later realised that what was started as an ASU was actually a different stratigraphic entity, then the ASU will get full spatial and temporal relationships). \n\n51 is the context also used for other cleaning tasks, such as cutting back sections (e.g 51*3,51*4,51*5)\n\nNote: any special finds that were visible and loose during cleaning of 51*1 were assigned to their original context, in consultation with Ariadne (who recorded the special finds themselves). Basically we went through the trench, and anything that was no longer embedded, but that she was certain was there last year, was assigned a special find number and was linked to its original context rather than the cleaning. After we went through the whole trench, Ariadne was able to confirm that there were no intrusive special finds (i.e. Everything could be linked to a proper context, rather than cleaning of the accrual deposit 51).\n\nZembeli count (rough estimate of soil content volume only - stone zembelia not counted): 14+ (51*2 =5; 51*3 = missing count;51*4=8; 51*5=1, see p112 in NB1)",[26.703 TO 26.703],214.59599999999998,"ENVELOPE(142.247, 156.922, 3501.323, 3475.92)","ENVELOPE(142.24735076754001283916, 156.92246389254000860092, 3501.32341380707021016860, 3475.91958255707004354917)","GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POLYGON Z ((148.19084764254 3501.32341380707 26.703, 142.24735076754 3478.05576443207 26.703, 150.87248389254 3475.91958255707 26.703, 156.92246389254 3499.08292193207 26.703, 148.19084764254 3501.32341380707 26.703)), POLYGON Z ((148.19084764254 3501.32341380707 26.703, 142.24735076754 3478.05576443207 26.703, 150.87248389254 3475.91958255707 26.703, 156.92246389254 3499.08292193207 26.703, 148.19084764254 3501.32341380707 26.703)))","POLYGON ((156.92246389 3499.08292193, 150.87248389 3475.91958256, 142.24735077 3478.05576443, 148.19084764 3501.32341381, 156.92246389 3499.08292193))","149.563, 3488.624",2018-09-03T15:15:41Z,Europe/Athens,D3F71F8C-8D42-4985-AF03-B919C1083382,D18-A3 - ASU 51*1\nD18-A3 - ASU 51*2\nD18-A3 - ASU 51*3\nD18-A3 - ASU 51*4\nD18-A3 - ASU 51*5,1A0D00FD-50DE-44EA-A4EB-F2447509F04F\n644A00C3-F0B1-4E02-B5B9-ACAF4095DCF2\n8C0337F0-269E-4AD1-A1EF-DCB1052E2A54\nE6A75DEE-9100-4B25-8634-D902221D6414\nEACAC3C7-9ECA-42D9-BCA1-19AF7DA233BF,D18-A3 - Surface 8\nD18-A3 - Surface 31\nD18-A3 - Structure 67\nD18-A3 - Structure 68\nD18-A3 - ASU 9*5\nD18-A3 - ASU 9*6\nD18-A3 - ASU 9*7,1CD52035-9C8B-46A6-A456-E2ED68E8E5E5\n22BF2D6E-7B2C-4631-93AF-78D171419B97\n26AF10BF-FD06-440B-8375-1A0FD7A252D0\n75299D69-65F0-44D4-B29F-BFE1EBD0768E\n778B67EB-C3F1-405D-B19F-12F9193889FA\nB66EF07F-FC48-4C70-82A7-B25A4679E745\nFF7400D0-6FC4-421C-B9A0-776458223F14,D18-A3 - Fill or Deposit 2,03ECB821-3990-4185-B21B-3208E2062FE5,,,D18-A3 - Fill or Deposit 26\nD18-A3 - Fill or Deposit 30\nD18-A3 - Fill or Deposit 32\nD18-A3 - Fill or Deposit 46\nD18-A3 - ASU 9*1\nD18-A3 - ASU 9*2\nD18-A3 - ASU 9*3\nD18-A3 - ASU 9*4,33B1C464-6769-416B-9E30-58163EB5B542\n393C6B4B-DAFA-45DC-9119-01C08445ED2E\n3E4FFA0F-CBB1-47AF-AF99-497C4B7E11AA\n46FE2DC2-44A9-48C8-AB15-21EFB091AB83\n6B118ADF-BB5A-4FC8-99E4-4E235063F2D2\n7FA684AC-FF79-40E4-A12B-BB411AC9F7C8\n9468DE4C-BBBD-476F-BC2F-32E322C89697\nD7218966-A8BF-4AFE-82E1-F5E69BD5F8D4,,,,,,

The lower number of finds and artefacts might suggest earlier deposition, pre major erosion and distribution from uphill (i.e. Before buildings had collapsed and exacerbated dispersal of material/susceptibility of material to taphonomy). The high number of mid-sized stones is bizarre (particularly as 57 lacks an equal number of larger building slabs, if we were to try to explain their presence as chinking stones in walls etc), unless they were from a facade or something built but not structural/supporting superstructure? The clay content might be washed/leached in from the collapse deposits to the east (53 and the newly exposed 58, both of which have high clay content soil between their stones), perhaps once functioning as a mortar, lining or binding agent of some kind. But to be honest, I still do not understand why this deposit is so different, especially in its clay content.\n\nNote: for open levels see ASUs\n\nField notes: This is an unusual layer distinct from (9) above in its soil aspect, which is a tacky mid yellowish brown clayey silt with frequent medium (6-12cm) sub-angular and sub-rectangular stone inclusions. It also has dramatically less of the larger ('cobbles' and 'boulders', c. 15-30cm) slabs and rubble (which looks to have eroded from the terrace levelling fill up to the east). \n\nIt has been partly removed by excavation in Trench 4, splitting the extant deposit into two areas (dug as ASU 57*1 and 57*2), but these would have originally been one consistent layer.\n\nIts nature remains ambiguous. It clearly overlies the concentrated wall collapse that started appearing below 9*8, which continues to dive (rather dramatically) down deep to the west, from the look of it, to the level at which Trench 4 ceased (where more large collapse slabs are still in place, lying at a flatter angle suggesting  they are not far off the ground level onto which the eastern walls (and perhaps superstructure of the space between walls 52 and 56 - IF this was a roofed space, a point that remains uncertain). \n\n57 might still be an earlier or lower layer of eroding tumble (perhaps formed prior to the final or major collapse of primary architectural elements, like walls), or it might be a different kind of fill. However the fact that it overlies and peels off the western collapse debris (large, consistently angled slabs which are concentrated quite high near the west face of Wall 40 and dive sharply off to the west, below 57), clearly indicates it is later, and so point to some kind of eroding deposition (or else a bizarre collapse event of some kind, but stones way too small to be used in major structural features except as small chocking stones betweenf larger ones, plus there is the high clay-silt content).\n\nThe clayey silt is particularly unusual, and Myrsini hasn't seen anything as moist (although she has seen something similar, but that was dry and compacted, not moist and tacky), nor do Michael or Ioanna recognise it as something found before in such a concentrated deposition. This tacky soil also looks to be found between the collapsed wall slabs (those below 9*5 and also 9*8), where it also seems to be more ""pure"" (almost no small and medium pebbles <6mm), suggesting perhaps some degree of sorting or selection or material. I cannot help wondering if it is some kind of clay lining, or mortar, seeing as it is so closely associated with the wall collapse (or structural collapse, if it did not all come from fallen walls). We obviously cannot confirm this until we dig the collapse debris, but if so, the the clay component of 57 might be eroded/slumped/washed in from the collapse layer to the east (as seasonal rain would easily move the finer grained soil from between the stones into its current position downslope around this rubbly and less large - or less mixed with eroding terrace levelling fill stones - layer of tumble).\n\nHopefully we will have a clearer idea once this is dug. Myrsine has also asked for us to keep an eye out for good areas of the clay to sample.\n\n20 Sep: \n57 was finished yesterday, after 57*2 had been chased and extended to the north, and 57*3 opened up in area of old Trench IV. In area of 57*1' the thick dark yellowish brown (dark reddish brown in places at times), moist and tacky clayey silt with frequent medium stones (smaller cobbles, c. 8-12 cm) came off a readily recognisable dense layer of wall collapse (58), and on the lower edge of 57*1 (along east TrIV boundary) off a compacted layer of mid to light yellowish brown gravelly silt (silt aspect = fine grained). The boundaries to both were distinct and sharp. \n\nTr IV however, had clearly cut into the compact yellow-brown in its west edge (presumably without recognising the change, as P304 of the publication says that 3-6 were arbitrary only, and that they only recognised one uniform layer of tumble), as was instantly clear when we cut back the scarp (57*3 might be more contaminated than other ASUs, but 57*2 equally an issue as close to surface in west edge of Tr A). In 57*3, there was really only patches of remnant 57 left in pockets over and around wall collapse slabs in west. \n\nHere in west, the slope of 57 levelled out to less than 10 degrees, and by end of excavation to nearly flat. In wester c. 90cm of 57*2, the mid sized stones of 57 were clearly sitting flat on a change, with a compact darker soil (slightly dif to that of the compact gravelly below 57*1 & 9*7/9*6) appearing. More anthropogenic material than rest of 57 (which had noticeably less material and special finds than 9) started appearing at this change.

Clearly this material is lying where it fell, (presumably from the west wall), rather than tumbled downslope by taphonomy. It also looks to have effectively sealed the lower deposits below, which is promising for both stratigraphic integrity and preservation.\n\nThis layer clearly represents material deposited during an ongoing sequence or process of collapse, as already at start of deposit it looks like a wall has fallen from somewhere in the west (too much debris, too far north, and at the wrong angle to have only come from Trench IV's Wall B, suggesting that it, or a continuation of it, may have extended to the NW, but it does not seem to have extended all the way to Wall 54 - although obviously none of this is clear yet and requires full removal of the collapse layers to verify or prove otherwise. Either way, this collapse episode (from west to east) clearly happened before the collapse visible at the top of the deposit fell over it (from the east and south it looks like, not from the north).\n\n19 Sep note: \nPots that have fallen in upside down: from shelves perhaps in the wall? They very much have fallen from above, but unlikely to have fallen or eroded in from the eastern terrace space (as too odd an angle for that, and also as well below the upper boundary of the wall collapse - i.e. Well below disturbed upper areas. \n\n20 Sep note:\nPatches of sandier yellow soil (more silty sand really - very coarse and sandy and mottled paler yellow almost whitish in places), usually only c. 30-40cm max (c.f. Photo 1010). Look to be more mixed lenses or patches (from what?) within the collapse matrix than pockets of soil from a different depositional event. Main colour of 58 changes from a dark reddish brown to a dark yellowish brown, but always a dark, moist and very tacky clay. Colour difference might just be taphonomic staining (e.g. As different stone materials have different reactions/ produce different colour changes during prolonged contact with water or soil), but perhaps also because original collapsed superstructure contained mixed material (e.g. Mortar/binding agent, roof, perhaps even a coating or lining on inner face of walls)\n\nAlso: Noticeable increase in the obsidian, shell, charcoal inclusions. This material is particularly frequent in the middle are of 58 (a c. 80cm diameter patch, roughly 1.20m from Wall 40 and c. 1.80 m south of Wall 52). This material is odd, as it is more reminiscent of occupation material, but it seems way too high for that - it is weird to get this in the middle of wall collapse, and this is definitely a concentration rather than remnant tumble/eroding contamination (too frequent and clustered,  and also well within the collapse/below the upper portion of the deposit. The obsidian is particularly frequent, as well as shell. But also, the charcoal flecks and pieces and bone are totally different to anything we have found before (9 had none of this).\n\n21 Sep note: more obsidian than yesterday even. Also, now more pots appearing (closer to the wall than upside down smaller pot) and these are not upside down. Basically pottery found throughout looks to have fallen from above every which way (tumbled from above, rather than downslope: shelves? Or something different?: the width of Wall 54 could be enough, if corbeled, to support a second storey perhaps? This might explain all the large slabs that loom to have fallen flat from above onto the layers below (e.g. The weird large flat slab that has been puzzling us since it was exposed with 9*5, as it clearly fell from above rather than in from the eastern side upslope), as well as the occupation material weirdly sandwiched and mixed in amidst the collapsed slabs.\n\n22 Sep: Pots removed today were mostly in or on the yellow change (i.e. Should be associated with 64 not 58, even though tops appeared with removal of 58: over dug into it). Lower pots were not upside down and inverted like earlier pots found on 20-21 Sep. The general impression is that they have fallen in here, rather than sitting on the lower yellow level at time of wall collapse. Either they were on shelves or similar in walls, or perhaps these support the musing over a possible second storey.

The boundary to 64 was moderately diffuse, but missed at first by the excavators removing the pots that first appeared at the base of 58. 64 has therefore been over dug in the far west (against Wall 73) where the tops of the pots first appeared in 58 and cast some confusion. The colour ranges from mid yellowish brown at upper (which added to the missing of the boundary) to a mid whitish yellow and bright golden yellow (more orangish yellow). The latter colours were most evident when the pots were freshly dug (and the alarm that caught AI/KPM attention from other parts of the trench), and interestingly the soil here was not gravelly as in the SE corner of 58, but a more uniform clayey deposit with patches of whitish or paler yellow throughout (hence this probably has more affinity or connection with the mixed ashy and clayey habitation lenses of 71,72,76,77 than the collapse layers of 58+86). \n\nAI notes: The deposit seems to be divided by a feature in the middle according to the soil chem that spots a huge drop of the lead rates in the S area (indicative of something solid blocking the dispersal of Pb infused soil and metallurgical debris throughout space). An alignment of three worked sub rectangular boulders could physically define this boundary although there is no sign of an articulated structure.\n\nIn this S area the soil is soft golden-yellowish brown clayey silt whereas in the N area (where we have the intensively high rates of lead) the soil is more clayey, soft dark brown.\n\nThree large fragmentary jugs appeared clustered in both S and N part fallen with the collapse.\n\nSmall patch of 64 found while cleaning the section of wall 73, below 58 and above 77.\n\nExcavators: AI, YC, SP, KJ\n\nZembeli count (rough estimate of soil content volume only - stone zembelia not counted): 7+ (sieve count tally for 64 missing for 30/9?

In one place at least is a c. 1-1.5cm patch of something drier and more friable and more orange. In general though, the whole thing is not dry or friable or vitrified, but seems to be instead a solid mass of clay for,ed into a single entity. At first it felt like mudbrick to dig, and was quite soft and easy to scrape away by accident wi too vigorous a towel. \n\nMyrsini commented that the matrix itself looks similar to the  clay used in roofs and floors and various capacities across the site. A small segment will be left in situ for her to sample later.\n\nAt first this was thought to be possible plaster or mudbrick patch emerging mixed with occupation material. Unclear if it fell from above (bizarre if so, as there seems to be patches of something like a surface around it, below 71 and the powdery layer below that. Unclear how all these could maintain their integrity if they fell from above. The alternative is that they are part of an emerging installation below (perhaps associated with the metalwork readings from Matt's geochem). However, these odd layers (71, 72, and what is below 71 and probably also 72) seem to sit above the collapse of 64, and the darker debris to the west that extends into area/alcove of 57*2.\n\n\n27 Sep: dark reddish brown humic below 72 revealed (by Georgia during sampling) to be root bioturbation.\n\n28 Sep: Also revealed at end of day yesterday (well, really only confirmed this morning: in bright afternoon light the excavator at first thought that the pale visible in the scarp left by 72's removal was 64, with a thin layer of grey 77 running over it: cf end of day and morning photos) that 72 was actually not a self contained /united entity, but a homogenous patch of ashy material within a mixed layer - it continued through the sides and into the grey clayey surrounding it, which also had other patches of differently coloured ashy clayey material throughout. \n\n\nAI note: Although at first 72 looked like a definable and distinct feature being above 77, its ashy burning patches continue deeper to the E creating an amorphous set of different soil matrix types. 72 is standing in more articulated wall collapse which may also have been some kind of installation coming up given the fact that they present burning surfaces. This fact confirms a massive burning linked to a possible metallurgical activity or just burnt collapse material.\n\n Excavator: AI; no sieve tally as intensive flotation sampling. \n\n3 Oct: note that open levels had to be retaken (twice it turned out) due to a persistent synch glitch that saw the original open levels (and the second set, when the open levels were retaken while the scarp of 72 still existed in 77, when we realised that the first set had gone missing) somehow wiped from the record. Trust the photogrammetry more (or cf with 71, 76, and 77 levels).\n\n\n12 oct: the missing levels returned mysteriously after synching with Nathan!! No idea what is happening, but have left both sets in here. If there are no data weirdnesses, trust the earlier levels.\n\n14 Oct: the earlier open levels have disappeared again, but now we have duplicate of the retaken open levels?

It's different than the gravelly sandy silt roofing clay of 58*2 which was already rich in organic material, (mostly charcoal and shell). This soft moist yellowish golden sandy clay with no gravel inclusions is well sorted. \n\nWhen we look at the subtile difference, even if the change was quite noticeable after some centimetres, with 58*1, 77 looks darker, softer being mixed with organic material although it still seats on some embedded stones and some collapse debris (rectangular and sub-rectangular stones).\n\nIt's marked by a density or cluster of artefacts and fragmentary occupation material (sherds, shell, charcoal, and bone), and two large broken sherds in situ between 58*2 and 77. The huge density of small preserved limpid shell in such a small area indicates either food debris either fuel, which would also explain the quantities of charcoal, the ashy matrix of 72 and the pots. \nThe colour changes are still not definite in 58*1 and we din't have a secure boundary between this one and 64.\n\n3-4/Oct:\n77 goes deep and reveals a NS alignment of large slabs that might form a kind of structure (possible platform?). This is because we though having something slightly different in the E part where 77 soil matrix is more mixed with ashy burning patches and yellowish ones. But soil chem shows the exact same hight lead rated in both E and W side of the context.\n\nA uniform compact mid yellowish polished layer appears after removing this mixture in the E. We still have the same concentration of burning occupation material like charcoal and shell with lead rates get higher as we go deeper. When it comes to wall 73 section, the occupation material (large sherd and random stones) clustered inside it and the lack of more foundation boulders supposes that we might have a surface on the collapse debris.\n\n5/Oct:\nThe deposit continues a mixed feel with its ashy burning patches and its firm light yellowish brown clayey silt layer spread all over without forming any clear boundaries. Clustered material -large sherds and building stones- are appearing deep inside wall 73 section. Although it was thought being posterior to all this amorphous set of layers, a set of worked foundation boulders was revealed showing how tilted-subsided to the W.\n\nThe mid yellowish soft clayey silt layer seems more or less uniform amongst the flat embedded sub rounded slabs which finally don't form any distinct structure as we thought. On the contrary the theory that they were part of burnt collapse seems more and more plausible. Under this yellowish layer there is much greyish brown firm soil in the SE which still seems mixed with 77.\n\n6/Oct:\nIn the NE side a layer of loose and moist mid dark brown silty clay soil was found under some of the embedded stones. Occupation material (large sherd, limpid shell, charcoal, polishing tools and lead) was found in this layer.\n\nAs we can clearly see in photo AA-103-0360-1 the section of 73 gives us a nice image of how mixed this deposit is. In particular we have this loose moist mid dark brown clayey silt with tiny gravel inclusions and a concentration of shell forming a distinct patch in the NE corner which looks like a pit cutting the yellowish uniform layer that covers most of 77. This sub rounded difference is cut in the SE by the soft yellowish layer that gives lower rates of lead than the dark brown part. Even if lead rates stay quite high to this whole corner, this slight but abrupt differentiation which is linked to the soil change makes this small corner between 52 and the embedded slabs susceptible for more intense metallurgical activity.\n\nDue to this complicated mixture of this deposit fallen with the burnt collapse we stop at this change even though 77 might continue deeper as the removal of one of those dressed slabs showed us.\n\n11/Oct: Opening of 77*3. Basically removal of the whitish ashy burning deposit left, partially because we need wall's 73 section exposed and mainly because we need to figure out the relation with 88. The same concentration of shell and charcoal came up and the removal of the large embedded slabs though to be a feature revealed a fine soft moist light yellowish brown silty clay that looks like 88.\n\n12/Oct: 77*3 end. Taking out more of the floating slabs roughly aligned N-S given the fact that we have no sign of a structure. The wall's 73 section shows a fine E face comprised of medium worked sub rounded and sub rectangular medium to large stones (10-15 cm) as we go deeper. At the same time wall 52 exposes a fine S face with rectangular medium stones and large sub rectangular boulders. Both have clay mortar in betweens. More occupation material comes through clustered in 73 section (sherds of all sizes). In addition beneath a large roofing slab a large storage pot was found upside down (~30cm). In that case the pieces in situ must have been smashed by these collapsed slabs (roofing and wall) and the others found upside down must have been fallen with the upper level floor or maybe from the walls.\n\nWhen it comes to the soil matrix, the removal of the ashy patches revealed a more consistent layer close to 88 but not quite the same. The soil is still mixed but at least it has the same texture, compaction and composition. In the N part gets soft light orangish sandy silt whereas in the middle it gets dark brown clayey silt to finish with a form mid yellowish sandy silt layer amidst another collapse deposit that seems to level off as the are sorted moderately (mainly sub rectangular embedded worked medium stones). \n\nThe reason we are stopping there, apart from this change after the extremely amorphous set of different soil patches, is because we need to keep these slabs in order to protect the more sensitive layers underneath. \n\nKpm note Oct 14: The lower deposit might still be more 77 (e.g. patches of a soft yellow reminiscent of 72 can be seen), however, it is far more uniform and also slightly browner than 77, and so we seem to either be at a deposit change, or approaching one (if the boundary is diffuse - difficult to assess without a section).\n\n\nExcavators: AI, SP, KJ \n\nNo sieve tally as intensively sampled for flotation (given the high amount of occupation material and food debris, and chance that we might be looking at the collapse of a second storey, or else some kind of dump? Would love more insight re the nature of the assemblages - Carly notes that from all these layers here, half of the shell is intensively burnt, the other half not, suggesting we are not looking at consistent burning of the entire assemblage in a single event, e.g. as fuel or destruction, but at something like accrual of different discard/dump episodes, or perhaps even the partial smothering of a burning upper storey occupation level when the superstructure collapsed - IF this deposit represents collapse that fell while burning)",[24.762 TO 25.276],1.465,"ENVELOPE(148.65, 150.164, 3487.977, 3486.657)","ENVELOPE(148.65000000000000568434, 150.16399999999998726707, 3487.97699999999986175681, 3486.65700000000015279511)","GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POLYGON Z ((149.858 3487.589 25.276, 149.723 3487.487 25.244, 149.881 3487.327 25.239, 149.86 3487.048 25.223, 149.556 3487.173 25.177, 149.235 3486.886 25.166, 148.975 3487.1 25.099, 149.206 3487.651 25.103, 149.45 3487.977 25.163, 149.522 3487.777 25.138, 149.858 3487.589 25.276)), LINESTRING Z (149.668 3487.481 25.232, 149.101 3487.168 25.113), POLYGON Z ((148.854 3486.802 24.981, 149.552 3486.657 25.071, 150.164 3486.662 25.154, 150.126 3487.514 24.964, 149.544 3487.722 24.935, 149.078 3487.593 24.907, 148.65 3487.503 24.762, 148.854 3486.802 24.981)), POLYGON Z ((149.168 3487.398 24.951, 149.271 3487.239 24.971, 149.269 3487.105 25.126, 149.386 3486.986 25.067, 149.488 3487.016 25.144, 149.637 3486.991 25.092, 149.896 3486.952 25.037, 149.9 3487.406 25.016, 149.168 3487.398 24.951)))","GEOMETRYCOLLECTION (LINESTRING (149.668 3487.481, 149.101 3487.168), POLYGON ((149.522 3487.777, 149.75519733 3487.64652054, 150.126 3487.514, 150.164 3486.662, 149.552 3486.657, 148.854 3486.802, 148.65 3487.503, 149.078 3487.593, 149.19529714 3487.62547067, 149.206 3487.651, 149.45 3487.977, 149.522 3487.777)))","149.458, 3487.241",2018-09-03T15:15:41Z,Europe/Athens,E65E1827-38EA-4D39-A4BE-8F9EB2D03097,D18-A3 - ASU 77*1\nD18-A3 - ASU 77*2\nD18-A3 - ASU 77*3,C2098AD2-26AD-4F2A-B18C-FB7C60CC04A2\nED2FBDD3-78CF-4C51-94CF-B42470CCC447\nF31831BB-64CF-4D32-852E-8E6A9E229657,,,,,D18-A3 - Fill or Deposit 58,F4405320-8FAD-49AF-9D42-9A9A2B56AF65,D18-A3 - Fill or Deposit 58\nD18-A3 - Fill or Deposit 72\nD18-A3 - Fill or Deposit 76\nD18-A3 - ASU 58*1\nD18-A3 - ASU 72*1,0804B221-2886-4C62-BC80-14C2F43C32F2\n23B858CA-C439-4BB5-A110-66D9727B0675\n2F5830E4-80FB-4C67-9074-7A79AE648EA5\nE6C02A35-7A26-4B55-8022-E5D2AA2B86FA\nF4405320-8FAD-49AF-9D42-9A9A2B56AF65,,,,,,

Almost no occupation material.",clear,,,"Mixed roof and wall collapse (from these mid terrace spaces, unlike 58 which must have also come from superstructure of upper east terrace spaces, e.g. From Wall 40)\n\n5 Oct (AI): \nMix of worked sub rounded, sub rectangular and rectangular wall building material, possible roofing material and unworked sub angular boulders and medium stones.\n\nUpslope to the E of the deposit part of this material is deeply clustered inside terrace wall 73, fact that stops us from having a clear image of the section otherwise we risk the collapse of a part of 73. When it comes to wall 56, its north face is more revealed with rectangular medium building stones put on to the other with clay mortar in betweens.\n\nSlight difference soil matrix started to appear after the removal of the debris. A firm light yellowish brown uniform clayey silt soil was found inside a different layer of collapse. As we follow this distinct difference we uncover a concentration of large embedded and dressed sub rectangular stones. We still have the same articulation of debris fallen in a  roughly strait way following an E-W line.\n\nThe density of this collapse is remarkable compare to 64 as well as the complete lack of occupation material (no signs of charcoal, pottery, shell, special finds or bone). This fact must be linked with the complete absence of lead and thus metallurgical activity compared to 64 and 77. This absence means that we have a post collapse mixed episode.\n\n6-7 Oct: Fully articulated collapsed wall revealed running E-W. The fallen material in the SE corner against wall 56 clearly dived from this same wall. We might have early collapse in this area from the superstructures 40 and 73 or even something else due to the same size of fallen large boulders. The roofing slabs appearing under this mix indicate that the roof was holding up after the wall collapse happened then fell through and brought these large worked sub rectangular slabs beneath the last of the small wall collapse.\n\nA firm yellowish brown sandy silt soil started to appear amidst the collapsed roofing slabs and wall debris which defined the end of the 86*1.\n\n10-11 Oct: Starting 86*2 in order to remove what's left of this deposit and level the middle area between 77-88 and 86*1. There is also the need to clarify the physical boundary that the soil chem has predicted defining where the metallurgical activity took place.\n\nUnderneath the firm light yellowish grey layer the soil becomes softer and more moist yellowish golden brown with white gravel inclusions. The embedded slabs forming a E-W line as a rough continuation of 44, 43 and 14, though to be the physical division are floating. The only possible sign of a structure is hidden beneath the large roofing slabs that need to stay in situ in order to protect the deposit from winter rain wash.\n\nAnother quasi structured feature is an E-W rough line of a set of worked sub rectangular boulders and rectangular worked medium stones in situ. Part of this possible structure is a large steatite rectangular worked and smoothed boulder (40x20cm). We hit a softer and more moist dark yellowish brown clayey silt soil amidst a layer of collapse slightly different due to its moderate sorting of building material which consists of medium to large horizontally embedded slabs and of fine rectangular wall stones that might belong to the supposed E-W structure-feature described before. After exposing more of 73 we closed the deposit. A pack of soil has been left to protect a fragile tilted part of 73 as well as a small patch of compact greyish roofing clay in the SW corner.\n\n\nExcavators: AI, RB, Vasilis, Stella P\n\nZembeli count (rough estimate of soil content volume only - stone zembelia not counted): 29 (86*1=19;86*2=10)",[24.788 TO 25.575],4.7330000000000005,"ENVELOPE(147.287, 149.914, 3486.395, 3483.964)","ENVELOPE(147.28700000000000613909, 149.91399999999998726707, 3486.39499999999998181011, 3483.96399999999994179234)","GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POLYGON Z ((149.688 3485.211 25.436, 149.718 3484.704 25.575, 149.588 3484.448 25.487, 149.394 3483.964 25.487, 148.829 3484.084 25.39, 148.233 3484.115 25.263, 147.637 3483.967 24.983, 147.287 3484.566 24.788, 147.775 3484.879 24.886, 147.734 3485.465 24.891, 148.001 3485.482 24.941, 148.685 3485.398 25.158, 149.374 3485.306 25.369, 149.688 3485.211 25.436)), POLYGON Z ((149.673 3484.73 25.534, 149.061 3484.697 25.342, 148.667 3484.221 25.339, 148.486 3484.796 25.19, 147.71 3485.166 24.987, 148.133 3485.291 25.012, 149.673 3484.73 25.534)), POLYGON Z ((149.914 3486.206 25.117, 149.047 3486.395 25.002, 148.465 3486.252 24.832, 149.267 3484.306 25.238, 148.576 3484.545 25.038, 148.033 3484.427 24.913, 149.914 3486.206 25.117)))","POLYGON ((149.914 3486.206, 149.01331978 3485.35416049, 149.374 3485.306, 149.688 3485.211, 149.718 3484.704, 149.588 3484.448, 149.394 3483.964, 148.829 3484.084, 148.233 3484.115, 147.637 3483.967, 147.287 3484.566, 147.775 3484.879, 147.75647004 3485.1438429, 147.71 3485.166, 147.75400987 3485.17900528, 147.734 3485.465, 148.001 3485.482, 148.685 3485.398, 148.82464131 3485.37935414, 148.465 3486.252, 149.047 3486.395, 149.914 3486.206))","148.702, 3485.083",2018-09-03T15:15:41Z,Europe/Athens,EF83A1A1-E493-4115-B41F-1DCF55B94992,D18-A3 - ASU 86*1\nD18-A3 - ASU 86*2,AA0CAA84-566C-42FD-B331-1778C1BA3363\nC9C1C9AB-34A6-474E-A2AD-50A6688E102B,D18-A3 - Fill or Deposit 127,AE2AC01C-AD59-410F-B8D4-88BCAACD70F6,D18-A3 - Fill or Deposit 127,AE2AC01C-AD59-410F-B8D4-88BCAACD70F6,D18-A3 - Fill or Deposit 58,F4405320-8FAD-49AF-9D42-9A9A2B56AF65,D18-A3 - Fill or Deposit 58\nD18-A3 - Fill or Deposit 64,DAE2ECEC-9B31-414C-A152-A540F3AE64EC\nF4405320-8FAD-49AF-9D42-9A9A2B56AF65,,,,,,

Given the amorphous mess of 71/72/76/77 to the east at roughly the same level, and all the artefacts at the transition between 53*2, it was decided to give this its own number. So it might still just be a deeper continuation of 58, but intimations that perhaps not.\n\nAI notes:\n7,9/Oct/17: After the removal of a thin layer of compact  greyish brown soil mixed with coarse gravel inclusions we reveal a homogenous layer slightly similar to 77 but not exactly the same. In particular, the soil gets more moist and softer dark brown clayey silt with smaller white gravel and shell inclusions. We are safe to say that we still have the same deposit given the fact that it's still rich in charcoal and shell.\n\nA set of small-medium worked and unworked sub angular and sub rectangular stones are appearing with no obvious structural articulation. Underneath them four large embedded slabs (two in 88*1 and two in 88*2) form a rough N-S line. In 88*2 they are sitting between wall 54 and 90. They are also clearly beneath the collapsed roofing slabs that need to come out if we want to clarify the physical boundary that separates 88-77 and 86 in metallurgical terms (high rates in 88-77, sudden drop off in 86).\n\nWhile teasing around the slabs to reveal any possible structure the soil matrix started to slightly change: a more fine yellowish brown silty clay with less inclusions came up which seems the same as 99 in the N boundary defined by a W-E blockage of building material. Thus, this consistent yellowish layers indicates a continuous change throughout two originally distinct deposits (88 & 99).\n\nThe same yellowish change comes through gradually in 88*1 since we can more easily chase it from the section of Tr 4. The lead rates stay high in the W part due to the diffusion of the intense activity up to the E.\nThe concentration of coarse pottery in the W part and the finding of the other half of the brazier found in 58*1 (pottery bag 1105) shows the diffuse boundary between the two and confirms the doubt that we went to deep back digging 58*1.  \n\n10/Oct: 88 is beneath 77. In the W part the removal of some loose roofing slabs and unworked boulders clearly out of place was needed to chase the difference. The fine light yellowish brown clayey silt came beneath the soft and more moist dark brown silty clay soil with gravel inclusions (smashed shell and tiny white stones). This change emerges to the E with a more greenish hue although the mixed nature of 77 make this boundary uncertain but sufficient to stop. The embedded slabs seem floating giving no sign of structure. \n\n12 Oct, KPM: very likely that 88 and 58 are contiguous, if so, then these are earlier than 53 (possibility too that we had over dug into 88 along the western edge of 58 without realising, and so the similarities with what we think of as 58's matrix might be due to mixing at that stage)\n\nExcavators: AI, SP, StellaP, FR\n\nZembeli count (rough estimate of soil content volume only - stone zembelia not counted): 7+ (88*1=7;88*2=missing tally?

Soil colour not dramatically mixed, but does take on a slightly different hue (more like a very dark yellowish brown) amidst the stones. The soil is very fine and moist sandy silt. There is some mixing in the west in terms of composition, where patches of clayier clumps (more of 57) break off from above the collapse stones of 89 and 93 below. These clayier clumps are above 61 in the south, but seem to lens below the west-most extent of 82+89 (where the latter two layers thinned out and did not quite reach the west section).\n\nInterestingly, 89 is practically sterile compared to 82 and 9 above, suggesting that we are in that liminal zone of early post-collapse deposition (also confirmed as 89 lies just above proper collapse debris), where material had yet to be dispersed significantly downhill, or simply that the tumble above and also upslope to the east acted like a filter (i.e. Letting through the soil, explaining the higher soil content with less gravel, but catching the small stones and artefacts)\n\nUnlike 82, there was no obsidian and barely any ceramics observed and collected during excavation (just one worn handle, that would have been susceptible to rolling downhill). The only special find was a kouphonisi pebble. There was a small amount of shell however. Interestingly, much of the shell from the sieve consisted of the tiny elongated land snails, that like to cling to the vertical faces of rocks and walls rather than gathering where water pools on horizontal surfaces (like the very prolific larger round land snails we have been finding everywhere, but particularly at the base of sharp boundaries between stone and soil deposits, as in 60 to 63 where dense clusters of round snails were gathered at the base of stones sitting on the top of 63 which had a higher soil component than 60: such dense clusters are normally good evidence for periods of abandonment or long durations where the deposits were exposed to rain water regularly). I have not noticed much of these small narrow land snails before, and definitely not in such quantity. They might perhaps point to a prolonged abandonment/collapse, where the walls were standing still, and the snails lived happily until the vertical surfaces collapsed (i.e. The walls fell in). As most of these snails were collected at the sieve, I unfortunately do not know if they were scattered throughout 89, or concentrated on 89's lower boundary i.e. amidst the collapse slabs of the semi articulated wall collapse below 89. They could equally have come from the far west, where 89 was not far under topsoil.\n\nThere are also a lot of large roots throughout this deposit, that have been tracing the boundary down to the collapse slabs, where water must pool. The bioturbation from these roots is likely the reason for the fine loose humic aspect (and darker colour perhaps even) of much of this deposit's matrix. Interestingly, there is no gravel content like in 82 and 53 above, and hardly any small stones (<5 cm) and none of the massive amount of medium worked building stones (8-12 cm, thin, with at least one dressed face) that characterised the transition of 9 down to deeper collapse in this area. Those medium stones in other deposits must be debris from the facade walls found throughout the site (e.g. In Tr.L) which consist of many of these smaller thin slabs that clearly could not support a superstructure but that are built against the larger (less aesthetically pleasing) boulder walls. Their absence in 89 is striking, suggesting perhaps that there were none of these wall facades in the immediate area (they seem concentrated in the upper east slope in the vicinity of the corner of walls 55&41, and near walls 35&33, and throughout the bottom terrace in deposit 57). \n\nThe linear line of tightly packed tumbled boulders was confirmed (as suspected from their rounded nature) as just that, and not remnant bedding or remnant foundations of a later construction. They might still represent bedding for something that was built post collapse here, but this seems unlikely. It is more likely that they were concentrated here as the E-W line of the wash gully channel (created by the topography of the wall collapse deposit below and lower ground level through this whole zone from e steps/path above in east to the lower terrace below in west) collapse debris narrows here at its deepest point, funnelling tumble/rolling debris down to gather at the lowest point. The linearity of this tumble patch was probably also augmented by excavation of 9*9 that early Saturday so long ago (but as I was not on site, I cannot confirm this).\n\n2 Oct: took off the last of 89 in the east, from what looked like it might be a small ledge or something built at a lower level than the suspected wall/continuation of 90 towards 75, but now proven (by exc of 89 in west on Sat) to be sitting (bizarrely flat) on top of angled collapse debris. Removal of this, & a little bit of 89*2, completed 89 and revealed a possible hint of a face below 98 to the east, which might be the beginnings of a preserved wall.

It sits above a lower floor packing fill (131) and surface (130), although the micro morphology sample should be cross referenced for confirmation of this interpretation.\n\nCoarser than normal? Pale yellowish brown, firm,  coarse (clayey? Sandy?) silt with frequent small and medium 'pebbles' (<1.5 cm, c. 5% of visible unexcavated matrix) sub rounded and sub angular gravelly inclusions. Occasional larger stone (sub angular mainly) protruding through surface. Matrix is firm and consolidated and fairly well sorted, but not as pale or as hard as others (such as 96, and maybe 87 above 96, which is so compact it almost seems par-baked).\n\nLess artefact inclusions than 70 above but ceramics and obsidian and even the occasional bone still present; certainly less carbonised material and definitely less carbonised material then 87 and 106 and 110, but again still the occasional fleck of carbon or small piece of charcoal.\n\n This deposit is incredibly difficult to define, not least because of the lack of built definition around it. It is however a consistent layer below both 70 and 104 (the latter was only identified in the east but could have existed in the west if we did not recognise it and accidentally dug it as 70).  Excavation of 111 confirmed 114 as a wall or intentional built structure, albeit it with its upper preserved course slipped in slightly to the west (see camera photos sequence for the end of 111). 114 had clearly been bedded against the bedrock using the drop in bedrock level to help support the wall as is common across the site. However we still lack definition on the west and especially also to the south, the north is defined by the bedrock, but the built transition to the bedrock is still yet to be found. There is rubble in the north that might represent the badly preserved bedding for some sort of wall or step, although it could equally be collapse debris, or even lower rubble bedding eroding in through the floor fills. The western boundary must comprise something built, as the ground difference between here and 125 to the west is too pronounced, with a clear drop that suggests there is somesomething built that retains the deposits 70, 97, and 130.\n\n16 oct:\nI regret trying to finish this area this season, although the intentions were good (in that we wanted to make sure we preserve the integrity of any phytoliths and environmental sampling associated with this deposit), as the lack of definition has proven problematic. Particularly in the south, where we hoped that some of the large stones that were visible at the start of 97 would turn into a wall or similar built definition. However, this did not eventuate and instead we still lack definition through here, and it is unclear if the deposit runs below the stones (as at least one end of one stone seems to float above the deposit, however it's southern side projects deeper into the soil), or it might stop here and the stones visible through this nebulous area are indeed severely damaged and badly preserved foundations from something built (however again, if so it is unclear as to the nature of this area, and whether these floors were associated with a room, or some kind of access or passage way running north to south). Far south of the stones there is no hint that 97 continues/exists still, and in fact it was thought that 84 must represent the eroded remnant soil from a floor deposit somewhere nearby (perhaps 97, or else something higher up to NE, like 111). We did the best we could, however in the south and south-east we might have lost some relations in our haste to finish 97 and also 131 below. We also cannot clearly relate these deposits to 114, as currently they look to run underneath the slipped upper slabs, but they probably ran up to wall 114 (i.e. the slipped slabs obscure the rest of 114 and how it relates to these deposits). It is now going to be very difficult to untangles the stratigraphy at the south end of 97, which needs to be investigated further in order to clarify whether the visible stones represent something built or if the stones are just floating, and how 97 relates to the stoney layer below 84 (which might be rubble bedding for the terrace, with the upper deposits now eroded away, or it might be more of the washed tumble like 62 and 98 south of it). \n\n\n   \n\nExcavator: RB, MG\n\nZembeli count (rough estimate of soil content volume only - stone zembelia not counted): 1 (most of soil = taken for.

It is darkest near the frequent roots, and so part of the mixed colouration is from bioturbation. The rest seems to be due to mixing from slope taphonomy, particularly episodic rain wash and the slow dragging of fine grained soil particles in from nearby upslope deposits. Hence the soil along north is more pale, as it has been washed down from the floor and collapse deposits nearby (e.g. 70, 96, 20, 16 etc)like that of 62 above, which is probably the same as 98 (lower wash tumble and eroded debris) just a later deposition. \n\n2 oct: same as 92, but darker yellow soil and more tightly packed.

It is much harder to dig with a trowel (also as so compact) as the boundary can be lost easily. If dug right with the hand pick, the matrix of 106 breaks off in large clumps, leaving a small skin of soil above the lower surface that then flakes off easily with the trowel.\n\nIt is very likely that the last day, perhaps even two, of work on 87 includes material from two floor packing fills, as the change was only recognised now. We at least tried to separate material for the two at this point, so we could sample appropriately and see if any differences are evident, and to allow comparison with MGk work.

This change was ephemeral, and needed to be chased from the east down to the west. 123 was however peeling off a more consolidated deposit below, which looked to be a sloped and slumping west edge of the clay floor packing. However, the excavator was not convinced that this change was real and had not been made up (similarly for the surface below 63, which she pointed out may have been cut/artificially created by the excavator, and felt was compact only because it had been walked on - in spite of my assertion that I had seen and been involved in the identification of that surface/change, although I agree it may have been slightly over dug in places at first, and perhaps not dug enough in its northern extent near the stone debris that may or may not be built), and to be honest, I had my doubts too - and so did not follow the boundary I started, but instead trowelled anew from the horizontal top rather than chasing the texture difference and change from the east.\n\nPossibly more left unexcavated in west, but seems to be below the rubble exposed in east above steps, so possibly something different (looks more similar to 100 than 123)\n\nNote: one tiny fragment of bone and one small (10 mm x 4 mm) fragment of obsidian were found, but blew away and could not be recovered. Bag numbers 1584 and 1585 cancelled and reassigned.\n\nExcavators: MG, KPM\n\nZembeli count (rough estimate of soil content volume only - stone zembelia not counted): 1 (more tallies missing?

The deposit had a clear compacted surface (130), from which 97 above broke off in nice levels. It is almost identical to 97 above, except for the fracture point of the boundary: there is a strong chance that both are the same thing, and that the different surfaces identified may have been resurfacing laminations for a single floor layer. Also, there is a strong chance that the surface identified as 130 may in places have been the construction surface, reached in some places but not in others (the area is problematic, due to erosion along the western edge (and the lack of a definitive superstructure to define it: we have just the hint that wall foundations exist here in the west, but with the floor packing fills perhaps slumped over the broken top preserved course? This area is highly disturbed) and also perhaps due to the difficulty in chasing a surface through a confined and interrupted area. For sure 97*2 was a little overexcavated in the SE, where (on one of my recurring visits) I identified a thin (<4mm) layer of 131 over the top if the largish (c. 25 cm) schist stone sitting flat at level with the bedrock (packing? Something earlier?), and explicitly instructed this area to be dug with a trowel only as anything else would remove this veneer (due to a miscommunication, this was then removed with a trowel, scraping the thin soil and surface off the harder stone below). Both excavators in this area felt that the surface/packing fill 130/131 and again 132 below, rose slightly to the SE through this area, perhaps curving up to a southern wall line, or simply rising with the bedrock ground level rise. Much more clarification work remains to be done re the structures in this area, and their relationships to the (now part excavate) deposits 70, 97, and 131 which might represent different floors or resurfacings of floors.\n\nModerate frequency of ceramics and shell (relative to such a small area at least), occasional obsidian and charcoal flecks (very small, and noticeably nowhere near as many as seen elsewhere, such as in 87 and 110. \n\nDifficult to discern relationships: the slipped stones from 114 hang over it from the east, leaving a large amount of soil beneath them (left for Myrsini to sample), and we lack spatial definition to the west and south (it was hoped that excavation of 131 would clarify these, but to no avail so far, although the large sub rounded slab to the south looks like it might have soil beneath it still and so might be floating; even in the north, where we should have been able to chase the floor out to the bedrock or perhaps the bedding of a wall we have just hit disarticulated medium rubble atones, reminiscent of the fill/stones below 84. \n\nDeposit peels off from a distinct change, a compacted deposit comprised of a cleaner clay almost totally absent of inclusions >1cm (and totally lacking in finds), that might perhaps be a construction surface or levelling bedding above the bedrock(/any foundation rubble fill). This deposit requires further investigation (grittier and sander, with a warmer hue in colour - some parts clearly look like the bright soil you get just before bedrock, but others look more anthropogenic), but unfortunately this was impossible during the time constraints of today (even with MG having taken over excavation of this area).
