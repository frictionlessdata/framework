# Contributing

We welcome contributions from anyone! Please read the following guidelines, and feel free to reach out to us if you have questions. Thanks for your interest in helping make Frictionless awesome!

## General Guidelines

We use Github as a code and issues hosting platform. To report a bug or propose a new feature, please open an issue. For pull requests, we would ask you initially create an issue and then create a pull requests linked to this issue.

## Docs Contribution

To contribute to the documentation, please find an article in the `docs` folder and update its contents. These sections can be edited manually:
- `docs/guides`
- `docs/tutorials`

Some documentation is auto-generated (for more information see `docs/build.py`). Here is a list of auto-generated sections (excluding `overview/whats-next` docs):
- `docs/references` (from the codebase's docstrings)
- `docs/development` (from the repository root's docs)

You can test this documentation using [Livemark](https://livemark.frictionlessdata.io). Livemark in a sync mode executes Python and Bash codeblocks in Markdown and writes the results back. Here is a quick example:

> Run `livemark` against an article only if you consider the article to be a trusted source.It will execute codeblocks marked by the `script` header.

```bash
livemark sync docs/guides/basic-examples.md --diff # get the diff
livemark sync docs/guides/basic-examples.md --print # print the doc
livemark sync docs/guides/basic-examples.md # update inline
```

It's possible to run this documentation portal locally. This requires Node.js 12+ installed on your computer, and can be run with the following code:

```bash
cd site
npm install
npm start
```

Alternatively, you can run the documentation portal with Docker. With
both Docker and Docker Compose installed on the system, first build the docker container with:

```
docker build --rm -t frictionless-docs .
```

then, every time you want to run the documentation portal locally, run:

```
docker-compose up
```

then open http://localhost:3000 on a web browser to see the portal.

To update a reference in `docs/references` and some other auto-generated documents please update the codebase docstrings or root documents. For more information about auto-generated documentation see `docs/build.py`.

## Code Contribution

Frictionless is a Python3.6+ framework, and it uses some common Python tools for the development process:
- testing: `pytest`
- linting: `pylama`
- formatting: `black`
- type checking: `mypy` (under construction)

You also need `git` to work on the project, and `make` is recommended.

After cloning the repository, you can set up the development environment
either by creating a virtual environment or a docker container.

### Using a virtual environment

Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies by following this code:

> this will install a `git commit` hook running the tests

```bash
python3.8 -m venv .python
source .python/bin/activate
pip install wheel
make install
alias "frictionless=python -m frictionless"
```

Note: You may need to run `sudo apt-get install postgresql libpq-dev` on a Debian-based system, because the python Postgres module depends on some postgres CLI tools.

### Using a Docker container

Use the following command to build the container:

```bash
make docker-setup
```

This should take care of setting up everything. If the container is
built without errors, you can then run commands like `make` inside the
container to accomplish various tasks (see the next section for details).

To make things easier, we can create an alias:

```bash
alias "frictionless-dev=docker run --rm -v $PWD:/home/frictionless -it frictionless-dev"
```

Then, for example, to run the tests, we can use:

```bash
frictionless-dev make test
```

### Using make

Then you can run various make commands:
- `make docs` - build the docs
- `make format` - format source code
- `make install` - install the dependencies (we did before)
- `make lint` - lint the project
- `make release` - release a new version
- `make test` - run the tests
- `make test-ci` - run the tests (including integration)

We also recommend running underlying commands like `pytest` or `pylama` to speed up the development process, though this is optional.

## Release Process

To release a new version:
- check that you have push access to the `master` branch
- update `frictionless/assets/VERSION` following the SemVer standard
- add changes to `CHANGELOG.md` if it's not a patch release (major or micro)
- run `make release` which create a release commit and tag and push it to Github
- an actual release will happen on the Travis CI platform after running the tests
