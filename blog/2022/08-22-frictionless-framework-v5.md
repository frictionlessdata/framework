# Welcome Frictionless Framework (v5)

We're releasing a first beta of Firctionless Framework (v5)!

Since the initial Frictionless Framework release we'd been collecting feedback and analyzing both high-level users' needs and bug reports to identify shorcomings and areas that can be improved in the next version for the framework. Once that process had been done we started working on a new v5 with a goal to make the framework more bullet-proof, easy to maintain and simplify user interface. Today, this version is almost stable and ready to be published. Let's go through the main improvements we have made:

## Simplified API

This year we started working on Frictionless Application, at the same time, as were thinking about next steps for [Frictionless Standards](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/). For both we need well-defined and easy-to-understand metadata model as paritally it's already published as standards like Table Schema and partially it's going to be publised as standards like File Dialect and possibly validation/transform metadata.

### File Dialect

### Checklist

### Pipeline

## Metadata Model

## Livemark Docs
